Key Strength

| Symmetric | Asymmetric |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 64 bit    | 512 bit    |
| 112 bit   | 1782 bit   |
| 128 bit   | 2304 bit   |

Hash
---
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA, SHA-1)
Message Digest Series Algorithm(MD2, MD4, MD5)

Authentication:
---
Kerberos - Ticket based system, symmetric key KDC
CHAP - exchange with hash values
Certificates - Used w/I PKI for asymmetric key
Username & Password - most common
Token Based - auth requires possession of token
Biometric
